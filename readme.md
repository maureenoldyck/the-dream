# The Dream : Currency converter 💸

## 👩‍💻 Learning objectives 
* Figure out what a form submit actually means / does
* How to get the form data after the submit
* Figure out a way to provide data in the HTML

## 🎖 Mission 

### Must-have features
* Check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
* Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form) and it'll tell you the price in Euros.
* Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

### Nice-to-have features
* Allow the user to choose between different currencies
* Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)

## 🎤 Tools
* VSCode: PHP, Markdown, CSS, HTML
* MAMP
